                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p>We use sticky elements too keep the elements (i.e. a header) where they are on the page while scrolling.</p>

            <div class="box relative">
                
                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>I utilized 10px for the top property (which moved the box down ten pixels) and 450 pixels for the left property to move the box to the right 450 pixels.  It moved the box as instructed.</p>

                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>I utilized 100px for the bottom property (which moved the box up 100 pixels) and 950 pixels for the right property to move the box to the left 950 pixels.  It moved the box as instructed.</p>

            <div class="box absolute">
                
                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>I utilized 10 for the bottom property (which moved the box up 10) and 10 for the right property to move the box to the left 10.  It moved the box as instructed.</p>
